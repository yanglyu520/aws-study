## AWS S3 Bucket Service:
understand the key in S3 bucket
### 1. Versioning
- how to turn on versioning for a bucket
- how to restore a deleted file
- how to permanently delete a file
### 2. Encryption
4 methods to encrypt objects in S3, SSE means server side encryption
- SSE-S3: encrypts S3 objects using keys. Keys are handled and managed by AWS
- SSE-KMS: encryption using keys handled and managed by KMS (user control + audit trail)
- SSE-C: encryption using keys outside of AWS and are fully managed by customers, must use HTTPS
- client side encryption: client will perform the encryption on the client side and upload the encrypted object to S3 bucket

Finally Encryption in transit(SSL/TLS):
Amazon S3 exposes:
- HTTP endpoint
- HTTPS endpoint: encryption in flight
### 3. Bucket Policies and Security
- User based: IAM Policies
- Resource based:
  1. Bucket Policies
  2. Object ACL - finer grain
  3. Bucket ACL - less common
### 4. S3 Websites
- S3 can host static website 
- the website url will be:
<bucket-name>.s3-website<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com
- make sure the bucket policy allows the public reads, otherwise you will get the 403 forbidden error

### 5. S3 CORS: cross-origin request
